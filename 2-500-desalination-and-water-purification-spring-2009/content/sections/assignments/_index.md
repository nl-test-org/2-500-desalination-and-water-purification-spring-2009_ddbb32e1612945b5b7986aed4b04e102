Term Project
------------

Problem Statement ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit2_500s09_project)) - This describes conditions in Phaeton and Paulette, including the results of field tests of several water supplies in the villages. It also sets out the requirements for the term project.

Q&A ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit2_500s09_questions)) - These are answers to some student questions by Amy Smith and Kofi Taha.

Phaeton & Paulette Water Testing ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit2_500s09_testing01)) - Test results for Phaeton and Paulette, Haiti. We believe that these may refer to the diesel pumped supply, not the ground water.

Phaeton Family Well Testing ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit2_500s09_testing02)) - Test results for the water sample collected from a hand-dug well in Phaeton during March 2009. They also include results for Sous Sale Bay and Pestel Harbor.
